# Introduction
This project's intents to indicate my knowledge on HTML, Javascript and CSS as a second year Software Engineering(BSc) Student.
HIIT Hustle project is HIIT exercise web applicaton where you can create fully unique HIIT workouts.

# Last-Update
- Redesigned for PC compatible
- Webpages polished

# Tools-and-Software-Languages
Along creating the HIIT Hustle, I have used several web application tools to enchance the game system and make an user-friendly interface.

## Visual Code Studio
VS Code is a code editor redefined and optimized for building and debugging modern web applications.
- It has a beginner-friendly and colored interface to understand the coding concept and debugging. 
- This project used VS Code for uploading the game files to GitHub and coding.

## HTML
HTML is a standart markup language for Web pages. This project written in HTML5 which is the lastest version of HTML.
Right now Virtual Cat Shelter consist of 2 HTML pages, but this number will be increase in the next versions with the new features.

## Javascript
JS is a programming language that is used to code web applications. This project uses it on the client side for webpage behaviour.
Right now there are 5 Javascript files that consists the Virtual Cat Shelter. It could be more in the future if there will be a database update.

## Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
CSS is a simple mechanism for adding style to HTML webpages. This project has only 2 CSS files for now.
There will be much more CSS files in future if this project will have more HTML pages.

## Scalable Vector Graphics
SVG is used to define vector-based graphics for the Web. Uses XML format and having support for interactivity and animation.
This project has 5 SVG files including cat breed images and a dirt stain image.
I have create 4 cat breed SVG files with my own knowledge. But, I took the dirt stain image from an open SVG [source](https://freesvg.org/vector-graphics-of-splash-stain-pictogram). Resize and changed it a little to fit the game.
